# STEAM-LFG
A web application (project for university) designed to help Steam players find other players for their games.

Players might find this useful for:
* achievement hunting
* player-vs-player matches
* co-op games

The account system is integrated with Steam, using OpenID technology to sign in through your actual Steam Account, no need for new accounts.
